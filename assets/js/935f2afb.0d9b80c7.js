We refer to \\"experiencing the experimental treatment\\" as exposure. For example, in a messaging experiment, some enrolled users do not meet the conditions to be shown the message. As another example, some experimental treatments require the user to restart their browser to take effect, so users who do not restart do not experience the treatment. Calculating results based on all enrolled users, when many users are not exposed, results in a diluted estimate of the treatment impact. For the highest precision, experiments should be configured with an Exposure Signal, which allows the analysis system to determine which enrolled users were exposed. See this page for more info including interpreting different bases.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"deep-dives/data/population_representativeness":{"id":"deep-dives/data/population_representativeness","title":"Exposure Funnel and Population Representativeness","description":"It is desirable for the group enrolled in a delivery (experiment, (micro)survey, etc.) to be a representative sample of the targeted population. A lack of representativeness could indicate selection biases that would invalidate learnings. We term a lack of representativeness as a \\"representativeness failure\\". This page documents common causes of representativeness failures.

The onboarding flow is presented to the user on each new install, and is made up of a series of full screen \'views\', referred to as \'cards\'. The purpose of the onboarding flow is to enable the user to configure a small number of app enhancing settings. Each card provides context for each setting and the ability to take an appropratie action, or skip to the next card.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"workflow/implementing/risk-mitigation/comms-sign-off/comms-sign-off":{"id":"workflow/implementing/risk-mitigation/comms-sign-off/comms-sign-off","title":"Comms Sign-off","description":"If your experiment includes ANY message, make sure you had an in-product message consult  and filed an FXE Jira ticket that was triaged via the Desktop or Mobile messaging leads (Venetia and Courtney).","sidebar":"sidebar"},"workflow/implementing/risk-mitigation/legal-sign-off/legal-sign-off":{"id":"workflow/implementing/risk-mitigation/legal-sign-off/legal-sign-off","title":"Legal Sign-off","description":"If Legal Review shows as Required, the answer to one of the Risk questions determined legal review will help mitigate a risk.
