### Question
If a client is unenrolled from an experiment (say they opt out of that experiment specifically) will they be able to enroll again if they meet the criteria?

### Answer
**No**. Once a user is disqualified by opting out (or through targeting, etc.) the client keeps a record of that and won't enroll back into the same experiment.
