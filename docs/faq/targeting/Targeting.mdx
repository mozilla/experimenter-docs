# Targeting dot releases or specific betas
*QUESTION: Can Nimbus experiments/rollouts target specific beta releases, 
ie can I express "roll this out to everyone on 104b6 and later"?*

ANSWER: Yes.
File an issue [here](https://github.com/mozilla/experimenter/issues/new) to add a specific version 
(of beta, nightly, or release) and then ping in #ask-experimenter.  


The version requested will get added as an option to the Minimum Version and Maximum Version drop down menues.  
It is a minor and quick change. 
By default Experimenter (Nimbus) only exposes the whole valued versions, until requested.
