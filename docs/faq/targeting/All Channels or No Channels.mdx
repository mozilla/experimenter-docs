### Question
What does "No Channel" or "All Channels" mean in the Audience Page?

### Answer
This should rarely if ever be used.  
It means ALL channels available to particular application (desktop, iOS, or Android).  

Ex: for desktop this includes ESR and Unbranded - which should only be receiving security fixes.
