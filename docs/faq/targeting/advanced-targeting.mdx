### Question
How can I add a new advanced targeting option for experiment audiences?

### Answer
To add new advanced targeting you can open a PR against the [`constants.py` file](https://github.com/mozilla/experimenter/blob/main/experimenter/experimenter/targeting/constants.py) in Experimenter. The advanced targeting is evaluated by the client at the moment we try to determine if we can enroll an eligible user. Think of it more like a funnel than a target.  All thatâ€™s needed is to add a new `NimbusTargetingConfig` object, e.g.:

```python
NEW_ANDROID_13_USERS = NimbusTargetingConfig(
    name="New Android 13 Users",
    slug="new_android_13_users",
    description="Users who have Android 13 and are on their first run of the application",
    targeting="(android_sdk_version|versionCompare('33') >= 0) && is_first_run",
    desktop_telemetry="",
    sticky_required=True,
    is_first_run_required=True,
    application_choice_names=(Application.FENIX.name,),
)
```

Targeting expressions are written in [JEXL (Javascript EXpression Language)](https://github.com/mozilla/mozjexl).
