Common questions about targeting and audience configuration for experiments and rollouts.

## All Channels or No Channels

### Question
What does "No Channel" or "All Channels" mean in the Audience Page?

### Answer
This should rarely if ever be used. It means ALL channels available to particular application (desktop, iOS, or Android).

Ex: for desktop this includes ESR and Unbranded - which should only be receiving security fixes.

## Version Targeting

### Question
Can Nimbus experiments/rollouts target specific beta releases, i.e. can I express "roll this out to everyone on 104b6 and later"?

### Answer
**Yes.**

[Here](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/mobile/android/docs/shared/versioning.md) is where you can learn about our dot release version naming pattern by platform (so is the first dot release x.1.0 or x.0.1)

If you are a mobile engineer, see the [Mobile FAQ](/faq/mobile-faq) for how to add a version. To find how the version numbers work for your platform check the [versioning documentation](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/mobile/android/docs/shared/versioning.md).

Otherwise, file an issue [here](https://github.com/mozilla/experimenter/issues/new) to add a specific version (of beta, nightly, or release) and then ping in [`#ask-experimenter`](https://mozilla.slack.com/archives/CF94YGE03) on Slack.

The version requested will get added as an option to the Minimum Version and Maximum Version drop down menus. It is a minor and quick change. By default Experimenter (Nimbus) only exposes the whole valued versions, until requested.

## Custom Targeting Options

### Question
How can I add a new advanced targeting option for experiment audiences?

### Answer
To add new advanced targeting you can open a PR against the [`constants.py` file](https://github.com/mozilla/experimenter/blob/main/experimenter/experimenter/targeting/constants.py) in Experimenter. The advanced targeting is evaluated by the client at the moment we try to determine if we can enroll an eligible user. Think of it more like a funnel than a target. All that's needed is to add a new `NimbusTargetingConfig` object, e.g.:

```python
NEW_ANDROID_13_USERS = NimbusTargetingConfig(
    name="New Android 13 Users",
    slug="new_android_13_users",
    description="Users who have Android 13 and are on their first run of the application",
    targeting="(android_sdk_version|versionCompare('33') >= 0) && is_first_run",
    desktop_telemetry="",
    sticky_required=True,
    is_first_run_required=True,
    application_choice_names=(Application.FENIX.name,),
)
```

Targeting expressions are written in [JEXL (Javascript EXpression Language)](https://github.com/mozilla/mozjexl).

If you need help writing the targeting expression, let us know in [`#ask-experimenter`](https://mozilla.slack.com/archives/CF94YGE03) on Slack.
