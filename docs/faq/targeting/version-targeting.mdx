### Question
Can Nimbus experiments/rollouts target specific beta releases, i.e. can I express "roll this out to everyone on 104b6 and later"?

### Answer
**Yes.** 

[Here](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/mobile/android/docs/shared/versioning.md) is where you can learn about our dot release version naming pattern by platform (so is the first dot release x.1.0 or x.0.1) 

If you are a mobile engineer, see steps [here](/faq/mobile-faq) for how to add a version.  To find how the version numbers work for your platform check https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/mobile/android/docs/shared/versioning.md.

Otherwise, file an issue [here](https://github.com/mozilla/experimenter/issues/new) to add a specific version (of beta, nightly, or release) and then ping in [`#ask-experimenter`](https://mozilla.slack.com/archives/CF94YGE03) on Slack.

The version requested will get added as an option to the Minimum Version and Maximum Version drop down menues. It is a minor and quick change. By default Experimenter (Nimbus) only exposes the whole valued versions, until requested.
