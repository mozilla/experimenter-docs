Common questions about Firefox Labs experiences, telemetry, marketing, and interaction with experiments and rollouts.

---

## Can I make changes to my Labs feature off-train from the release channel?

Once a Labs rollout has been signed off and launched, the only changes you can make to the live rollout are:

- **Adjusting the population percentage** (the "Percentage of clients" on the Audience page).
- **Ending enrollment** to stop new opt-ins (see [Graduating a Labs feature](/workflow/firefox-labs#graduating-a-labs-feature)).

Any other changes require ending the existing rollout and launching a new one.

Keep in mind: once you put something in Release, users get the code in-tree. If you expect an opportunity to iterate based on user feedback, what they get on Day 1 will sit until Day 1 of the next release version.

## What kind of telemetry is available in Labs?

It's important to transition existing telemetry from legacy to Glean and track which checkboxes are clicked. The Glean team can help determine requirements.

---

## How do we market features available in Labs?

Each Labs feature is encouraged to create a dedicated Mozilla Connect thread, giving it public exposure from the start. See [Marketing your Labs feature](/workflow/firefox-labs#marketing-your-labs-feature) for available channels.

## What happens if a user has telemetry turned off?

As of Firefox 148, users can retain access to Firefox Labs if they disable telemetry. Rollouts and Labs experiences have been decoupled from telemetry so that browser enhancements and fixes can reach a larger user population. (See more on the [Remote Improvements](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/remote-improvements) choices.)

However, Labs will **not** appear for users who have opted out of "Install and run studies" in `about:preferences`. If the user has opted out of studies, the Labs section in Settings will show up as a blank screen.

---

## What does success look like for a Labs experience?

Since Labs promotes qualitative metrics, success is measured through Connect feedback, engagement metrics, and bug tickets — anything we can collect as learnings, especially ones we could share in public-facing product communications. Labs feature opt-ins are expected to be small since this appeals to early adopter users who skew more towards being technically-savvy.

---

## Can I run an experiment and/or rollout at the same time as a Labs experience?

Labs are configured as rollouts, so you *can* be in an experiment and a Labs experience at the same time. However, the experiment will take precedence over the Labs experience and override anything that the Labs experience established. If you end up in experiment:control, you will have opted in and your feature will no longer work.

You will need to choose between running a Labs experience and running a rollout at a given point in time, since people won't be able to enroll in the rollout if they're in the Labs experience, and vice versa.

**Preferred approach:** If you are going to launch an experiment and a Labs experience at the same time, launch the experiment *first* and then exclude the experiment population from the Labs experience so that the Labs toggle doesn't show up in `about:preferences#experimental` for users who shouldn't see it.

---

## Can I retarget a client who has opted into a Labs experience for a different experiment/rollout?

While Labs experiences may target 100%, users do not count as enrolled unless they opt in, so you can use normal "include" targeting to target a survey or experiment to users that were in a Labs experience.

---

## What happens if I'm already enrolled in an experiment?

You won't see the Labs experience affiliated with the same feature, since enrollment in an experiment takes precedence over a Labs experience.
