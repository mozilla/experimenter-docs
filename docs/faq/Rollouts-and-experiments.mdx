### Question
Can a client be in a rollout and an experiment for the same feature at the same time?

### Answer
**Yes**, we have separate namespaces which means you can run rollouts and experiments for the same feature simultaneously and each namespace does its accounting for users separately. 
You can run a 100% rollout and a 5% experiment and both will fill up, but everyone in the experiment is also in the rollout.  When a user is in both an experiment and a rollout for the same feature - they will get see the experiment.  When the experiment ends - the rollout will apply.

The rules:
- Users can be in only 1 experiment for each feature at a time.
- Users can only be in 1 rollout for each feature at a time.
- Users CAN be in multiple experiments + rollouts on DIFFERENT Features.

After 100% of users are in a Feature Rollout - users will not enroll for new rollouts for that same feature.  New Experiments or rollouts that launch (when their feature's experiment or rollout respectively is at 100%) will see low to no enrollment.

### Question
If there is a concurrent experiment and rollout on the same featureId, once the experiment ends, assuming the rollout is at 100%, a given client will immediately be put into the rollout.  Correct?

### Answer
The short answer is **“yes”**, in most situations.

The long answer is: while both are running, an experiment client with actually be enrolled in both and the treatment they’ll receive will be the combination of both. This enables clients in subsequent experiments to easily get rolled out winners of prior experiments.

If both the experiment and the rollout are focused on the same fields of the treatment JSON, **the experiment will take precedence** and in this case the behavior will be as you state: effectively, the client immediately joins the rollout.

If they’re focused on different fields of the JSON, the behavior the clients gets will go from “experiment+rollout” to “rollout only”.

### Question
What does this warning mean?

<p/>
   <img title="Duplicate bucket warning" src="/img/faq/dupe-rollout-warning.png" align="center"/>

### Answer
If you are using the [multiple-rollout approach](/deep-dives/experimenter/rollouts#without-using-live-editability), this warning can be safely ignored because you are explicitly creating more than one rollout in the same bucket. However, if you are using [live editability for rollouts](/deep-dives/experimenter/rollouts#live-editability), this warning tells you that there is a rollout that is **already live** that has the same application, channel, feature, and advanced targeting as the rollout that you are creating. This means that there will be collision, and your rollout will not function as-is. Users are already enrolled in the live rollout with the same criteria, and they will not be able to enroll in your rollout.

If you are encountering this and you would still like to proceed with your rollout, feel free to reach out to us in [#ask-experimenter](https://mozilla.slack.com/archives/CF94YGE03) on Slack  and we will be able to provide more guidance.
