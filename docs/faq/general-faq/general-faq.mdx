### What's the difference between "Experimenter" and "Nimbus"?

Nimbus is the code name of the experimentation project, so Nimbus refers to **the whole experimentation system** (handles enrolling/unenrolling users, sending branch configurations, etc). Experimenter is the **customer interface to both Nimbus and Jetstream** that you access at http://experimenter.services.mozilla.com/. In Experimenter, users can configure experiments, manage them (launch, monitor, end), and can see the results.

### What is Jetstream?

[Jetstream](/deep-dives/jetstream/overview) is the whole **analysis system** (interfaces with data, runs analysis, formats results).

### What is Normandy?

Normandy (https://experimenter.services.mozilla.com/legacy/) is the legacy experimentation platform for Firefox. It is being deprecated in favor of Nimbus.

### How long does it take to see Nimbus changes on the client (for time sensitive QA or hotfixes especially)?  CDN

- Nimbus uses remote setting to get changes to users.  Remote settings pushes updates to its CDN once an hour.  Then it has geoip specific dns resolution and caching and etc.  

- Depending when you make your change and when RS propagates to CDNs - it could take minutes to just over an hour.

- Desktop clients only recompute enrollments at startup and every six hours thereafter.  So if you are looking to "naturally" get enrolled in an experiment (versus using [Preview](https://experimenter.info/previewing-experiments) to force enroll) on desktop there could be an even longer delay.

### How long does it take to run an experiment?

Experiment length will vary depending on:
- How soon users will encounter your change?  If the action is something people do rarely (ex: edit a pdf) you may need to observe longer for people to encounter the change
- We typically enroll for 1 week - to get a balanced section of people across Monday, Tuesday,..., Saturday.  If you have very few people that qualify (ex: new users on iOS only from Portugal) - enrollment may take longer.
- We OBSERVE based on what questions you are trying to answer.
  -  If people see your change immediately (ex on every page load) and send in the data you need a few days or a week of observation may be enough.  
  - If you want to know the impact on 2 week retention - there is a week of enroll + 2 weeks of observation
  - If you want to know the impact on Days of Use - there is a week of enroll and 4 weeks of observation.
