**What happens at experiment end?**
See the [Experimentation Workflow](/ending) for general information about ending experiments.

### Question
Is feature restart supported?

### Answer

Yes! Feature restart is supported by Nimbus. This is how it works when a feature requires a restart:
* **Session 1:** Client enrolls, applies feature configuration, but the feature itself won't implement the changes until the next restart
* **Session 2:** Client is enrolled, feature configuration is applied, feature now shows changes

:::tip Important
Please share that this experiment needs a restart in your data science Jira ticket and that there is custom work needed at analysis to exclude the pre-restart data.

### Question
If there is a problem and I need to abort the experiment and rollout, will cancelling the experiment and rollout revert the feature flags to their pre-experiment and pre-rollout states (i.e. feature is disabled) for all users enrolled so far?

### Answer
Ending means Nimbus stops applying the change, so users will go back to whatever state they would have without the experiment or rollout applied.  If you have a complex feature - you can verify by asking QA to test that scenario before release as well.
