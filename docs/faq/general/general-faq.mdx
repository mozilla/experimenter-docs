### Question

What's the difference between "Experimenter" and "Nimbus"?

### Answer

Nimbus is the whole experimentation system (handles enrolling/unenrolling users, sending branch configurations, etc).  Nimbus was the code name of the experimentation project.  If you hear Jetstream, that is the whole analysis system (interfaces with data, runs analysis, formats results).  Experimenter is the customer interface to both Nimbus and Jetstream - that you access at experimenter.services.mozilla.com/.  In Experimenter users can configure experiments, manage them (launch, monitor, end), and can see the results.
