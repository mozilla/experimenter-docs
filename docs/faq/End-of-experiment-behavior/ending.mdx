# What happens at experiment end?
## Feature state changes
*Question: If there is a problem and I need to abort the experiment and rollout, will cancelling the experiment and rollout revert the feature flags to their pre-experiment and pre-rollout states (i.e. feature is disabled) for all users enrolled so far?* 


Answer: Ending means Nimbus stops applying the change, so users will go back to whatever state they would have without the experiment or rollout applied.  If you have a complex feature - you can verify by asking QA to test that scenario before release as well.
