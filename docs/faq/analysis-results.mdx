### Question
Is there a straightforward way to get the results from an experiment programmatically? Like a JSON object or something that I could convert into a dataframe?

### Answer
**Yes.** Results are available in bigquery and GCS, though what you see in Experimenter has been transformed a bit.

Daily, weekly and overall results are in this bucket as JSON (you may need to request permission to access this data):
* https://storage.cloud.google.com/mozanalysis/statistics/statistics_device_migration_new_user_onboarding_pt_2_daily.json
* https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/_details/mozanalysis/statistics/statistics_device_migration_new_user_onboarding_pt_2_daily.json;tab=live_object?project=moz-fx-data-experiments

Example query:

```
from jetstream.bigquery_client import BigQueryClient
PROJECT_ID = 'moz-fx-data-experiments'
DATASET_ID = 'mozanalysis'
client = BigQueryClient(PROJECT_ID, DATASET_ID)
df = client.table_to_dataframe('statistics_<slug>_overall_1')
```

### Question
If I create a custom config for an experiment, will I still get results for the primary and secondary outcomes, if I select them? Or will the config completely overwrite those outcomes?

### Answer
You will still get the outcomes even with a custom config.
