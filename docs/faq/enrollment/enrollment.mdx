## When is a user enrolled?

### Question
When a user receives a recipe, are they enrolled immediately or at the next session?

### Answer

For [first run experiments](/mobile-first-run-experiments), the recipe is bundled with the app.

For existing users, the flow is: 
> 1) Firefox starts
>
> 2) Existing enrollments are applied fast
> 
> 3) Browser continues to start
> 
> 4) Nimbus syncs and computes new enrollments
> 
> 5) New enrollment prefs are set

So if your feature only reads prefs right at startup, then the pref wouldn't be applied until the following session.

:::tip
You can use `isEarlyStartup` to persist the prefs to disk so that they are available as soon as possible at startup.

## Unenrollment

### Question
If a client is unenrolled from an experiment (say they opt out of that experiment specifically) will they be able to enroll again if they meet the criteria?

### Answer
**No**. Once a user is disqualified by opting out (or through targeting, etc.) the client keeps a record of that and won't enroll back into the same experiment.
