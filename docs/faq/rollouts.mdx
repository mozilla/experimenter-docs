### Question
Can a client be in a rollout and an experiment for the same feature at the same time?

### Answer

**Yes**, we have separate namespaces which means you can run rollouts and experiments simultaneously and each namespace does its accounting for users separately. You can run a 100% rollout and a 5% experiment and both will fill up, but everyone in the experiment is also in the rollout.

### Question
What happens when an experiment and rollout are on the same feature, and the experiment ends?

### Answer

Typically users will see the experiment applied, and then get the rollout treatment when that ends with a small delay to re-evaluate.

If both the experiment and the rollout are focused on the same feature, **the experiment will take precedence** and in this case the behavior will be seeing the experiment, when that ends the client will unenroll, then upon next recipe evaluation will join the rollout.

UNLESS the feature is mobile messaging, in that case while both are running, an experiment client with actually be enrolled in both and the treatment they'll receive will be the combination of both. This enables clients in subsequent experiments to easily get rolled out winners of prior experiments.  If they're focused on different fields of the JSON, the behavior the clients gets will go from "experiment+rollout" to "rollout only".

### Question
How do I decide when to end a rollout?

### Answer

**For features that become on by default:** We typically wait 1-3 releases for the upgrade tail to catch up. You'll probably have the vast majority, so it just depends on the ramifications if people have it enabled on an older version and then lose it when they upgrade.

If it's **not** a big deal if the feature goes away, turn off the rollout in the next release. People who haven't yet upgraded will lose the feature until they upgrade.

If it **is** a big deal for the feature to go away (think UX changes or bug fixes) - turn off in 2-3 releases later and you'll have reached a few percent more with each release.

If it is a very big deal - we sometimes leave those running for 6 months or so to hit maximum reach. Please remember to set a reminder appointment to people on your team so someone remembers and doesn't leave it on forever.

### Question
How quickly can I get to 100% with a staged rollout?

### Answer

**Your sizing steps** are a balance of:
- how many users do you need to gain confidence to go to the next step?
- How big of a step are you comfortable with?

Some common patterns are:
- Low risk:  5, 10, 50, 100 (the steps may be bigger if only a fraction of the population will use the feature)
- Med risk: 1, 5, 10, 25, 75, 100
- High risk or scaling risk: .5, 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100 (ex: you are worried about too many people using a back end server at once, and want to test small capacity loads)

The first step is usually the one where issues are discovered.  It's easy to stop the rollout, land fixes, and start again with a higher minimum version (after the fixes have landed).

**The speed you increase** is based on:
- What are you observing to decide you are OK moving forward?
- How long will it take to see those changes?

Some common patterns are:
- Fast:  2 days, 7 days, 10 days (ex: a frequently used feature, where the telemetry exists for your team to easily see issues)
- Med: 1 week, 2 week, 3 week
- Slow: 2 week, 4 weeks, 6 weeks (ex: it takes users a while to use the feature or looking at revenue or other indirect impacts)
