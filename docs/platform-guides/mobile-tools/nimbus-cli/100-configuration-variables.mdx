This guide covers environment variables for configuring the CLI, including paths to platform tools, API URLs, caching, and server settings. These variables allow you to customize the CLI's behavior.

## ADB and XCRun Paths

The CLI assumes that [`adb` and `xcrun` are on the `PATH`](/technical-reference/nimbus-cli/install#rerequisites). If they are not (or aren't spelled `adb` or `adb.exe`), then you can configure them via the `ADB_PATH` and `XCRUN_PATH` environment variables.

```sh
export ADB_PATH="/Applications/Android Studio.app/platform-tools/bin/adb"
```

```sh
export XCRUN_PATH="$HOME/Library/CustomXcode/bin/xcrun"
```

## Experimenter URLs

Experimenter URLs are used for accessing experiments via the `/api/v6` endpoints. They're hardcoded into `nimbus-cli` for both stage and production versions. However, just occassionally you may want to change these URLs.

e.g. for a local development version of experimenter with `localhost`:

```sh
export NIMBUS_API_URL=https://localhost:8080
export NIMBUS_API_STAGE_URL=https://localhost:3030
```

## Remote Settings URLs

URLs for Remote Settings are also hardcoded into `nimbus-cli` for both the stage and release versions. Like Experimenter, you may occassionally want to change these URLs.

e.g.

```sh
export NIMBUS_URL=https://no-cdn.remote-settings.mozilla.com
export NIMBUS_STAGE_URL=https://no-cdn.stage-remote-settings.mozilla.com
```

This has been helpful in the past when trying to debug a problem with CDN, or Remote Settings has moved.

Note: while the Remote Settings represents what the live apps see, there is approximately 1 hour latency between changing an experiment on Experimenter and it being synced to Remote Settings.

## Manifest Cache

The manifest downloading happens on each invocation of the `enroll`, `validate` and `test-feature` commands.

You can speed this up by setting directory as the cache for downloading the manifests:

```sh
export NIMBUS_MANIFEST_CACHE=./caches/fml
```

However, it should be noted that for some files (especially downloading from `main`), they change even though the URL remains the same.

For this, you should consider putting into your `.profile` file something like

```sh
export NIMBUS_MANIFEST_CACHE=$HOME/.local/state/technical-reference/fml/$(date -Idate)
```

so as to only use the cache for one day.

## Suppressing Update Checking

The `nimbus-cli` periodically checks for a new version. This can be disabled by setting the following environment variable.

```sh
export NIMBUS_CLI_SUPPRESS_UPDATE_CHECK="true"
```

## Server Host and Port

By default, the server that is started with `nimbus-cli start-server` uses the machine's network interface to derive the external IP address.

Communicating with the server is done by other instances of `nimbus-cli` by posting to the `/post` endpoint. The port and host can be configured with the following environment variables.

```sh
export NIMBUS_CLI_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0
export NIMBUS_CLI_SERVER_PORT=9090
```
