This guide covers how to test experiments on Android using the preview flow, including launching experiments and testing procedures.

## Launching an Experiment to Preview the Stage Server

The first step to testing the preview flow is to launch an experiment. Go to [experimenter](https://experimenter.services.mozilla.com/) and create your experiment.

For experiments that are already live, go to the summary page. For experiments that have not yet launched, you will need the author to click "Launch to Preview" on the Review & Launch page.

## How to Test

   Here is a [quick overview video overview of testing on Android](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SkcWOEsMUjhpwScfE1Hbss53XAII4IkJ/view).  That is the best place to start to understand the QA landscape.  

   There is a [step by step recorded training](https://mozilla.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=9ba378b3-db23-4adf-8819-b2f10114378d) with the [slide presentation containing all the commands references in the training](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iwpvqJ2LzNAM_Ww4FN0bB3rHdMgK6LBeCCj2sRHO2BY/edit?slide=id.g82c578dc07_2_1796#slide=id.g82c578dc07_2_1796).  This is the ["How To Document"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xpJK47xPoT0Wel9LXYs6hV_Mvkt9jnQLLNC87UQRvzo/edit?tab=t.0) that follows the presentation.
