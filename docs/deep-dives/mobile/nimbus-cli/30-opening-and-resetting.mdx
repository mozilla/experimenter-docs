The commands that open the app do so by simulating the app's launch as if the user tapped on the app icon on the phone; these are:

- `enroll`
- `unenroll`
- `test-feature`
- `apply-file`
- `log-state`
- `open`.

In addition, the `enroll`, `open` and `test-feature` commands, can launch the app with a deeplink.

# Deeplinking

`nimbus-cli` knows the apps' deeplinking schemes, and if no `://` is detected in the deeplink, then the deeplink scheme is appended.

## `open`

For example:

```sh
nimbus-cli --app firefox_ios --channel developer open
```

launches the app with `simctl`:

```sh
$ xcrun simctl launch \
        booted \
        org.mozilla.ios.Fennec \
        --nimbus-cli \
        --version \
        1
```

```sh
nimbus-cli --app firefox_ios --channel developer open --deeplink deep-link?url=settings/general
```

opens the deeplink (i.e. not sending directly to the app) with:

```sh
$ xcrun simctl openurl \
        booted \
        fennec://deep-link?url=settings/general
```

By default, each of the commands that launches the app also kills the app right before; with the `open` command you can send the app a deeplink without killing it, using the `--no-clobber` property.

```
nimbus-cli --app firefox_ios --channel developer enroll ios-set-to-default-in-onboarding-final --branch treatment-a
nimbus-cli --app firefox_ios --channel developer open --deeplink deep-link?url=onboarding/privacy-first --no-clobber
```

### Deeplinks for other commands:

> iOS `simctl` does not support command line arguments with the `openurl` command. Opening with a deeplink while enrolling in an experiment is not supported.

## `enroll`

For Android, opening a deeplink uses the same mechanism as launching the app: using Intents. Thus, we can enroll in an experiment and then open the app with a deeplink.

```sh
nimbus-cli --app fenix --channel developer enroll release-android-onboarding-redesign --branch treatment-a --deeplink onboarding/privacy-first
```

## `test-feature`

Similarly, you can use a `--deeplink` to enroll a [`test-feature`](/nimbus-cli/test-feature) experiment.

# Terminating and Resetting the app

`open`, `enroll` and `test-feature` all support a `--reset-app` option, which serves to reset the app back to its just-installed state before opening.
