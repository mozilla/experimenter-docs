The `nimbus-cli` is a command line tool for interacting with the Nimbus SDK embedded in Mozilla's mobile applications.

It aims to provide a uniform way of interacting with an app, no matter what the app or the platform.

### Goals

The principle goals for the `nimbus-cli` is to make testing and developing experiments easier:

 - to force the app [to enroll into a given experiment](/nimbus-cli/getting-started#enroll), regardless of where the experiment is in its lifecycle
 - [to find the names of experiments and branches](/nimbus-cli/getting-started#list)
 - to [reset the app](/nimbus-cli/getting-started#reset-app) back to a just-installed state
 - to allow more concise Steps to Reproduce in bug reports.

Additionally, it is useful to be developers to investigate problems with the apps and with the internal state of the Nimbus SDK:

 - to [test feature configurations](/nimbus-cli/test-feature) without needing to interact with experimenter
 - to [validate experiments and feature configurations](/nimbus-cli/fml) against the app's feature manifest
 - to [display and capture the logs](/nimbus-cli/working-with-logs) of the device
 - to [display the state of the Nimbus SDK in the logs](/nimbus-cli/working-with-logs#log-state).

### Non-goals

The tool works by using the existing tooling provided by platform vendors (for Android, `adb`; for iOS, `simctl`) to communicate with an installed app on a device, emulator or simulator.

No attempt is made to help installing or uninstalling of the apps on to devices.

Since `simctl` is not able to interact with iOS devices, then neither is the `nimbus-cli`.
