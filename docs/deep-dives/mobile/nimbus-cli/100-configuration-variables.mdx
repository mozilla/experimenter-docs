## `adb` and `xcrun`

`nimbus-cli` assumes that [`adb` and `xcrun` are on the `PATH`](/nimbus-cli/install#rerequisites). If they are not (or aren't spelled `adb` or `adb.exe`), then you can configure them via the `ADB_PATH` and `XCRUN_PATH` environment variables.

```sh
export ADB_PATH="/Applications/Android Studio.app/platform-tools/bin/adb"
```

```sh
export XCRUN_PATH="$HOME/Library/CustomXcode/bin/xcrun"
```

## Remote Settings

Remote Settings is hardcoded into `nimbus-cli` for both the stage and release versions. However, just occassionally you may want to change the URLs.

e.g.

```sh
export NIMBUS_URL=https://no-cdn.remote-settings.mozilla.com
export NIMBUS_STAGE_URL=https://no-cdn.stage-remote-settings.mozilla.com
```

This has been helpful in the past when trying to debug a problem with CDN, or Remote Settings has moved.

## Manifest Cache Directory

The manifest downloading happens on each invocation of the `enroll`, `validate` and `test-feature` commands.

You can speed this up by setting directory as the cache for downloading the manifests:

```sh
export NIMBUS_MANIFEST_CACHE=./caches/fml
```

However, it should be noted that for some files (especially downloading from `main`), they change even though the URL remains the same.

For this, you should consider putting into your `.profile` file something like

```sh
export NIMBUS_MANIFEST_CACHE=$HOME/.local/state/fml/$(date -Idate)
```

so as to only use the cache for one day.

## Suppressing update checking

The `nimbus-cli` periodically checks for a new version. This can be disabled by setting the following environment variable.

```sh
export NIMBUS_CLI_SUPPRESS_UPDATE_CHECK="true"
```
