The `nimbus-cli` is a tool to communicate with the Nimbus SDK that is embedded in an app.

- [Instrumenting iOS apps for testing](/getting-started/engineers/getting-started-for-ios-engineers#instrumenting-the-app-for-testing).

## Adding new applications

[Adding a new app to the cli](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/blob/main/components/support/nimbus-cli/src/config.rs) is less straightforward, but not hard. You should start collecting the following information:

For all apps:

- the `app_name` according to Experimenter.
- the names of the `channel`s for the app, according to Experimenter.
- the Github repo for the app
- the location of the app's FML file within the Github repo.
- the mapping between version names and branch names.
- the Remote Settings collection names for both production and preview.

For Android:

- the package name, for each channel
- the main activity name.
- the deep link scheme, for each channel

For iOS:

- the app identifier, for each channel
- the deep link scheme, for each channel

Once you have collected these, you should either talk to the Nimbus Team, or open a PR against [the project](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/blob/main/components/support/nimbus-cli).
