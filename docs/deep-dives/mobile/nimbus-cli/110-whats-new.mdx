### `0.3.0`

- Now using the Experimenter API to get experiments, instead of Remote Settings. This saves time waiting for the sync between Experimenter and RS.
- Split `fetch` into a [`fetch`](/nimbus-cli/working-with-files#fetch) for named recipes and [`fetch-list`](/nimbus-cli/working-with-files#fetch-list) for getting a list; this changes the parameters for `fetch`.
- [Passthrough parameters](/nimbus-cli/opening-and-resetting#passthrough-parameters) for finer control of the app launch process. Thanks Ben, for the suggestion.
- A new [`features` command](/nimbus-cli/working-with-features#features) for get the feature configuration out of the experiment. You can also [merge with the defaults](/nimbus-cli/fml#features) from the manifest.
- A new [`defaults` command](/nimbus-cli/fml#defaults) to get the defaults from the manifest.
- A new [`info` command](/nimbus-cli/getting-started#info) to get information about the experiment. This can be good for investigations.
- Experiment slugs can be derived from Experimenter URLs.
- Where you can read and write JSON, you can now read and write YAML.
