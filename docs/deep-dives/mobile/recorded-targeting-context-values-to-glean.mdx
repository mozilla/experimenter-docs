In order to support automated population sizing efforts, the Nimbus SDK has been updated to include an interface by
which values that are a part of the Nimbus targeting context can be recorded to Glean. This page documents how to
implement the aforementioned interface, and provides guidance on updating the Nimbus targeting context moving forward.

There are a number of implementation details that are worth noting. The first to be covered is how the code is
structured in Rust, as it uses some of the more complex features of UniFFI, followed by how the code is structured in the Firefox
Android and iOS repositories.

## Rust Nimbus SDK code

To start, a new Rust trait was defined, with methods to be implemented to perform four key functions.

1. `to_json`: to return a JSON representation of the `RecordedContext`'s values
2. `get_event_queries`: to return a map of an event query name to an event query
3. `set_event_query_values`: to set the internal calculated values for the event queries
4. `record`: to record the internal values of the object to Glean

```rust
pub trait RecordedContext: Send + Sync {
    /// Returns a JSON representation of the context object
    ///
    /// This method will be implemented in foreign code, i.e: Kotlin, Swift, Python, etc...
    fn to_json(&self) -> JsonObject;

    /// Returns a HashMap representation of the event queries that will be used in the targeting
    /// context
    ///
    /// This method will be implemented in foreign code, i.e: Kotlin, Swift, Python, etc...
    fn get_event_queries(&self) -> HashMap<String, String>;

    /// Sets the object's internal value for the event query values
    ///
    /// This method will be implemented in foreign code, i.e: Kotlin, Swift, Python, etc...
    fn set_event_query_values(&self, event_query_values: HashMap<String, f64>);

    /// Records the context object to Glean
    ///
    /// This method will be implemented in foreign code, i.e: Kotlin, Swift, Python, etc...
    fn record(&self);
}
```

We then use the UDL to define this trait such that it uses foreign implementations. As such, we will end up with kotlin/
swift classes that implement the methods as described above.

```
[Trait, WithForeign]
interface RecordedContext {
    JsonObject to_json();

    record<string, string> get_event_queries();

    void set_event_query_values(record<string, f64> event_query_values);

    void record();
};
```

We also have some internal Rust methods extending off the trait for validating/executing the event queries, but they are
not really of much consequence to implementing developers.

## `to_json`

The JSON object value returned from `to_json` will ultimately be flattened on top of the existing fields present in the
targeting attributes. **Values present in the targeting attributes by default will be overridden by values in the
recorded context.**

```rust
// components/nimbus/src/stateful/evaluator.rs
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, Clone, Default)]
pub struct TargetingAttributes {
    #[serde(flatten)]
    pub app_context: AppContext,
    pub language: Option<String>,
    pub region: Option<String>,
    #[serde(flatten)]
    pub recorded_context: Option<JsonObject>,
```

Below is an example implementation of `to_json` in both Kotlin and Swift.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="kotlin"
  values={[
    { label: "Kotlin", value: "kotlin" },
    { label: "Swift", value: "swift" },
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="kotlin">

  ```kotlin
  // RecordedNimbusContext.kt
  override fun toJson(): JsonObject {
    val obj = JSONObject(
      mapOf(
        "is_first_run" to isFirstRun,
        // more fields here
      ),
    )
    return obj
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="swift">

  ```swift
  // RecordedNimbusContext.swift
  func toJson() -> JsonObject {
    guard let data = try? JSONSerialization.data(withJSONObject: [
      "is_first_run": isFirstRun,
    ]),
    let jsonString = NSString(data: data, encoding: String.Encoding.utf8.rawValue) as? String
    else {
      return "{}"
    }
    return jsonString
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## `get_event_queries`

In both Kotlin and Swift, as long as the member variable for `eventQueries` conforms to the type `Map<String, String>`
it can be simply returned from this function.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="kotlin"
  values={[
    { label: "Kotlin", value: "kotlin" },
    { label: "Swift", value: "swift" },
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="kotlin">

  ```kotlin
  // RecordedNimbusContext.kt
  override fun getEventQueries(): Map<String, String> {
    return eventQueries
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="swift">

  ```swift
  // RecordedNimbusContext.swift
  func getEventQueries() -> [String: String] {
    return eventQueries
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## `set_event_query_values`

In both Kotlin and Swift, as long as the member variable for `eventQueryValues` conforms to the type
`Map<String, Double>` it can be simply returned from this function.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="kotlin"
  values={[
    { label: "Kotlin", value: "kotlin" },
    { label: "Swift", value: "swift" },
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="kotlin">

  ```kotlin
  // RecordedNimbusContext.kt
  override fun setEventQueryValues(eventQueryValues: Map<String, Double>) {
    this.eventQueryValues = eventQueryValues
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="swift">

  ```swift
  // RecordedNimbusContext.swift
  func setEventQueryValues(eventQueryValues: [String: Double]) {
    self.eventQueryValues = eventQueryValues
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## `record`

The `record` method should actually record the context's value to Glean. The Glean metric's definition can be found in
the `metrics.yaml` file.
- [Android `metrics.yaml`](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/mobile/android/fenix/app/metrics.yaml)
- [iOS `metrics.yaml`](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios/blob/main/firefox-ios/Client/metrics.yaml)

```yaml
# metrics.yaml
nimbus_system:
  recorded_nimbus_context:
    type: object
    structure:
      type: object
      properties:
        is_first_run:
          type: boolean
        event_query_values:
          type: object
          properties:
            days_opened_in_last_28:
              type: number
```

The metric definition determines what properties exist for the Glean types, so we must make sure to use those types when
setting the value for the metric.

  defaultValue="kotlin"
  values={[
    { label: "Kotlin", value: "kotlin" },
    { label: "Swift", value: "swift" },
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="kotlin">

  ```kotlin
  // RecordedNimbusContext.kt
  override fun record() {
    val eventQueryValuesObject = NimbusSystem.RecordedNimbusContextObjectItemEventQueryValuesObject(
      daysOpenedInLast28 = eventQueryValues[DAYS_OPENED_IN_LAST_28]?.toInt(),
    )
    NimbusSystem.recordedNimbusContext.set(
      NimbusSystem.RecordedNimbusContextObject(
        isFirstRun = isFirstRun,
        eventQueryValues = eventQueryValuesObject,
      ),
    )
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="swift">

  ```swift
  // RecordedNimbusContext.swift
  func record() {
    let eventQueryValuesObject = GleanMetrics.NimbusSystem.RecordedNimbusContextObjectItemEventQueryValuesObject(
      daysOpenedInLast28: eventQueryValues[RecordedNimbusContext.DAYS_OPENED_IN_LAST_28].toInt64()
    )

    GleanMetrics.NimbusSystem.recordedNimbusContext.set(
      GleanMetrics.NimbusSystem.RecordedNimbusContextObject(
        isFirstRun: isFirstRun,
        eventQueryValues: eventQueryValuesObject,
      )
    )
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Additional methods

Two additional methods have also been exposed to assist developers with a) validating their event queries and b)
calculating targeting attributes that have historically been provided by the Rust code. `validateEventQueries` is used
in testing, to ensure the event queries being run are in fact valid event queries.

`getCalculatedAttributes` accepts the app installation date, the path to the Nimbus database, and the locale string,
executes some commands in Rust to read from the database and calculate additional fields based on the installation date,
and returns the resulting values to the caller. It should be used during the construction of any foreign implementation
of the `RecordedContext` trait.

## Adding new fields

The new field should be added to the `RecordedNimbusContext` class in each of the following locations:

- the constructor
- as a member variable **(Swift only)**
- the `record` method
- the `toJson` method
- the `create` method **(Kotlin only)**
- the `createForTest` method **(Kotlin only)**

The field also needs to be added to the appropriate `metrics.yaml` file for the application, under the
`nimbus_system.recorded_nimbus_context` metric.

- [Android `RecordedNimbusContext` class](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/mobile/android/fenix/app/src/main/java/org/mozilla/fenix/experiments/RecordedNimbusContext.kt)
- [Android `metrics.yaml`](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/mobile/android/fenix/app/metrics.yaml)
- [iOS `RecordedNimbusContext` class](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios/blob/main/firefox-ios/Client/Experiments/RecordedNimbusContext.swift)
- [iOS `metrics.yaml`](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios/blob/main/firefox-ios/Client/metrics.yaml)

:::info

In the future, the goal is for this file and its tests to be statically assessed to ensure all the fields are present where they should be.

## Adding new event queries

Event queries are marginally simpler to add than new fields. Adding a new one requires the following changes:

- a new `const`/`static` value for the event query's name
- a new record in the `EVENT_QUERIES` map
- a new entry in the `event_query_values` property in the `nimbus_system.recorded_nimbus_context` metric
