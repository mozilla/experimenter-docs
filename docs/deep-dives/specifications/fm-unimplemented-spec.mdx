## Future specifications

This document houses a number of proposals not ready for comment. They are not linked to from the spec.

### Feature defaults and runtime targeting

> ⚠️ Unimplemented. This is intended to use the same JEXL targeting used elsewhere in Nimbus SDK.

Occassionally, we would like to vary a configuration based upon the device. In this example, the `homepage` feature has sections for both Pocket and Topsites.

```yaml
features:
  homepage:
    variables:
      pocket-enabled:
        description: If true, show stories from Pocket. This is only available in certain territories.
        type: Bool
        default: false
      topsites-enabled:
        description: If true, show tiles from the users most recent and frequently visited pages.
        type: Bool
        default: false
    defaults:
      - channel: nightly
        value: { topsites-enabled: true }
      - channel: nightly
        targeting: locale in ['en-US', 'de-DE', 'en-GB']
        value: { pocket-enabled: true }
```

In this example, `pocket-enabled` defaults to `true` only on the `nightly` channel and when the device locale is in `US`, `DE` or `GB`.


### Types coerced from `String`

We have already seen enums being declared in the `types` section of the manifest.

Other types that may be derived from `String`:

 * `Color`
 * `URL`

## Variables and fields with no defaults

### Required fields

Some object fields do not have a sensible default value, but without them, the object itself doesn't make sense.

For example a `MessageItem` doesn't make sense unless it has a `message` and a `deeplink`. Where any required fields are missing from the JSON, the `MessageItem` is incomplete, and cannot be used.

Incomplete objects cannot be included in maps, lists or optional types.

In this case, a message surface is added to the `new-tab`, but isn't always needed to be displayed.

```yaml
features:
  new-tab:
    variables:
      message:
        description: An optional message
        type: MessageItem?
        default: null
types:
  MessageItem:
    description: …
    fields:
      label:
        type: String
        required: true
      deeplink:
        type: String
        required: true
```

In these cases, the app code must deal with the cases with objects that are said to be failable, because there are no defaults.

```swift
let newTabConfig = FxNimbus.features.newTab.value()

if let message = newTabConfig.message {
    // We have to check that the message exists, because the message may not exist.
    displayMessage(message.label, message.deeplink)
}

// continue configuring the new tab.
```

### Failable features

Feature `variables` may also be marked as `required`. In the cases where these variables are missing, then the whole feature no longer makes sense.

Features with `required` variables must be marked as `failable`.

```yaml
features:
  emergency-startup-message:
    failable: true
    description: A message displayed to the user at start up.
      variables:
        message-content:
          description: The long form message to be displayed to the user
          type: String
          required: true
        color:
          description: The background color of the screen
          type: String
          default: red
```

Failable features are implemented as Optional. If the feature is incomplete or failed, then it is returned as `nil` or `null`.

```swift
guard let message = FxNimbus.features.emergencyStartupMessage else {
    // phew, there is no emergency message.
    return
}
```

Features with `required` variables which should be marked `failable` but aren't will produce an error.

## Imports and Includes

#### Unclear/scope–creep/YAGNI

- The importing `.fml.yaml` file should not have access to types from the imported one.
- The imported file may not have an `import` list.

> Eventually it might be necessary to have imported files recursively importing other files.
> Implementing this proposal will give an idea of how much extra complexity is required.

#### Connecting to different languages or contexts

The `import` block does two different roles:

1. Giving `experimenter` knowledge of the imported features.
2. Sending experimental configuration from the application singleton into the components.

For features written in a different language, the feature configuration needs to travel across an FFI.

```yaml
import:
    path:      @mozilla/gecko-dev/fenix.fml.yaml
    channel:   production
    connector: gecko-view
    features:
        autofill:
            - value: {}
```

Imports for the same connector are gathered up so we can get a `Map<String, JSONObject>` containing configuration from the experiment (and the app-specific defaults) by calling:

```kotlin
FxNimbus.connectors.geckoView.value()
```

The app will need to send this to the right place, for example:

```kotlin
val nimbus = Nimbus.shared
nimbus.register(object : Nimbus.Observer {
    fun onExperimentsApplied() {
        val features: Map<String, JSONObject> = FxNimbus.connectors.geckoView.value()
        geckoView.setNimbusFeatures(features)
    }
})
```
