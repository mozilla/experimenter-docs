# Commands

## Generating code for an mobile application

The simplest invocation is in this form:

```
% nimbus-fml generate --language <LANGUAGE> --channel <CHANNEL> <INPUT> <OUTPUT>
```

`LANGUAGE` can be `kotlin` or `swift`.

`CHANNEL` is one of the channels specified in the FML file.

`INPUT` may be a local file or directory.

`OUTPUT` should be a local file or directory.

If `INPUT` is a directory, it is recursively searches for any files with names ending in `.fml.yaml`.

This command should be called at build time of components and the build time of the application.

### Adding `repo-file`s

Adding [repo files](fml-paths) can be done with one or more `--repo-file` argument.

```
% nimbus-fml generate --language <LANGUAGE> --repo-file ./app-structure.json <INPUT> <OUTPUT>
```

### Caching remote files

```
% nimbus-fml generate --language <LANGUAGE> --channel CHANNEL --cache-dir ./build/cache-dir <INPUT> <OUTPUT>
```

[For `include` and `import` directives in the FML](/fml-imports-and-includes), a remote file may be referenced. The cache directory is a local cache of these remote files.


## Generating a manifest file for experimenter

The reason to use a custom manifest format a language specific JSON serialization library is to do with keeping the code in sync with the experimenter web server.

For legacy reasons, this is a different format of yaml file, which should be checked in to version control and is periodically pulled in by experimenter.

```
% nimbus-fml generate-experimenter <INPUT> <OUTPUT>
```

This should only be called at the application level, with the one main fml file as an input.

`--cache-dir` and `--repo-file` arguments are also supported.
