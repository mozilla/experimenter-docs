With Nimbus experiments, instead of a centralized committee responsible for launching and running experiments **we want you, the experiment owner, to drive the process from ideation to completion**.

If you are interested in learning more about your responsibilities, you can find our complete [Access Control Policy here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r8oI_Hxe5JQcOejqZcSziX1Aso20AFGBToTFu3BE5j8/edit).

### Onboarding

In order to use the Nimbus platform to create and launch experiments, you will need to go through our [onboarding process](https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/FJT/Nimbus+Onboarding#NimbusOnboarding-Branches). Please reach out to Ana Medinac on Slack to schedule a session.

### Reviews

All changes to experiments and rollouts that impact production must be approved by a single L3 Nimbus reviewer, which you can request via the Nimbus console interface. You can find a list of [recommended reviewers here](https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/FJT/Nimbus+Reviewers).
