# What's New in Nimbus August 2022

## Welcome

The Nimbus team will have a **demo booth at #moz-aloha** All-Hands at the end of September! Come find us, chat about experimentation, and maybe even grab a sticker!

## Exciting Changes

### Mobile First Run

Mobile First Run refers to the work done in Nimbus to allow experiments during an user's first run of the Firefox mobile app.
- Instrument Nimbus SDK in telemetry in order to provide experimental treatments during the onboarding experience.
  - This was affecting more than 100,000 clients and over 1.5M events/requests.

### Cancel Review

If you launch, end, or end enrollment for an experiment it automatically goes to Review. Now, there is an option
to cancel that change and go back to an idle state where changes can be made.

### UI/UX Updates

Various user experience updates to streamline workflows and provide more consistency throughout the tool, like:
- Improved labels
- Analysis Results Time -- now you can see on the Results page when the last analysis started
- Performance improvements
- All displayed dates now include the year

### Improved Testing and Validation

- Better integration testing
- Better validation of configurations
