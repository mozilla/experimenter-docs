# What's New in Nimbus July 2022

## Welcome

The Nimbus team has welcomed a new team member: Charlie Humphreys, Mobile.

We're thrilled to have Charlie on board!

## Exciting Changes

### Sticky Enrollment

- When creating an experiment, users can now opt for sticky enrollment (clients will not be unenrolled, even if the targeting becomes false, until the experiment ends). This information is now visible on the experiment’s "Details" page so that the user can review if they have opted for sticky enrollment.

- In addition to that, a new warning has been added when creating a new experiment. If an experiment is using a targeting configuration that requires sticky enrollment, sticky enrollment would be auto selected to support that targeting expression.
- - Ex: if you target New Users, which is based on profile age, after a few days - they are not "New Users" anymore.  You do not want users to unenroll from the experiment - so that criteria has "sticky" defaulted.

- The default is to not have this.   There are only a small set of cases where you are changing a pref that users may later change - and you don't want to unenroll them based on that choice. 

### Normandy

Normandy will continue to be supported until Nimbus can take over for its responsibilities. So in the meanwhile, we have restored the create button in the old Experimenter interface.

### Feedback

Now a feedback [link](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=10203&issuetype=10097) is also available on the landing page. Don’t wait to give us any feedback!

### Feature enabled

- #### Desktop

  Firefox Desktop 104 is removing support for the feature enabled toggle, so experiments Firefox Desktop 104 and above will require feature enabled to be on for every branch.

- #### Mobile
  The feature enabled flag has been disabled entirely for mobile experiments. Every branch of a mobile experiment must specify a feature value, which may explicitly be an empty object "{}".

Stay tuned for the next month's letter!
