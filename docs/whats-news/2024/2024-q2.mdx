## Experimenter

🛎️ Experiment end date adjusts if enrollment goes longer than initially entered.  
   > When an experiment needs to enroll longer than initially planned - the end date now will be pushed as many days as are added to the enrollment period.  This means no more early emails to end your experiments when they need more observation time.

   > Example:  You anticipate 7 days of enrollment, but after 7 days you do not have enough users.  You talk to data science and agree there is no harm in extending enrollment by another week.  Now if you don't end the enrollment at 7 days - it will recalculate when to send the "end experiment reminder" to ensure you still have the planned observation window to collect enough data.
