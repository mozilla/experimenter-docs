# What's Newsletter

## February 2001


Hey Nimbus customers! 

Welcome to our very first edition of our ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs New‚Äù-sletter. As our customers, we want to make sure we keep you in the loop with new Nimbus features and capabilities on a monthly basis.

Are you looking for a great Friday night movie? I'd highly recommend watching Les, Lauren, and Marina's video for [a deep dive into all our new features](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CfAOKypY8TpD9-7RNlaGG8oL9FZDr-Lr/view).

Here is a sneak preview of some of the video highlights:

* üìá Curious to see upcoming or completed experiments? Check out our new [Nimbus directory](https://experimenter.services.mozilla.com/nimbus/)!
* Data is now flowing into the Nimbus from Jetstream and you can navigate to experiment results from the Directory View or from the side bar!
* üìà P.S don‚Äôt forget to check out the results of the [On/Off About:Welcome experiment](https://experimenter.services.mozilla.com/nimbus/onoff-aboutwelcome-experimentsults)
* üìä Speaking of metrics, we have added `Days Of Use` as our guardrail metrics in the visualization. We now also have added graphs in the visualizations so experiment owners can see how the metric progresses over time.
* ‚è∏Ô∏è Don't have all the information to complete the page you're working on right now? Don't worry, we‚Äôve removed some of the required fields so it‚Äôs easier to save your progress. 
* üóÇÔ∏è Have you ever felt really lost trying to juggle Mana, Jira, Google Docs, and Nimbus to find all your docs and tickets? We sure have, so Nimbus now offers the ability to add your relevant tickets and documents into Nimbus, and you can easily access them then from our summary page in the future. 
* ‚ö†Ô∏è We know, there's nothing more frustrating than getting an [error message and not knowing what it means](https://media.tenor.com/images/866143f03774004d9897ddc23240226d/tenor.gif)! ‚ö†Ô∏è We just couldn't let that happen on Nimbus and now we have the right validation and error messages in our UI. Luckily, you will always know what's wrong now.
