This edition introduces live rollout editing, the Nimbus Gradle Plugin move to Application Services, new testing tools, and messaging surface updates for Android and iOS.

## Rollouts
Nimbus now supports edits for live rollouts! This allows owners to make changes to the population percentage and publish them. See our [rollouts deep-dive](/advanced/rollouts) for more info!

## Nimbus Gradle Plugin
The Nimbus gradle plugin has been moved from Android Components to Application Services. Updated information for utilizing the plugin can be found [here](/platform-guides/android/integration).

## Testing Tooling
For injecting experimental feature configurations for integration tests, we now have the following:
 * Added a `malformedConfiguration` event for app features to report bad configurations.
 * Added a `record_past_event` method to test display triggers based on the event store.

## Messaging
We’re in the last stretch of QA for adding a notification surface to the Nimbus Messaging system on Android (thank you @twhite and @mheres). For iOS, the survey surface has landed (thank you to @yrios and @roux).

### More exciting changes coming next month!
