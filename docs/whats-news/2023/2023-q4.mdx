ðŸ™Œ FML error detection - [EXP-3873](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/browse/EXP-3873), [EXP-2365](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/browse/EXP-2365)

   > Error detection using the Feature Manifest Language is now available in Experimenter! For all applications that utilize the FML (non-desktop apps), the "Branches" page now uses the FML to detect when a feature configuration is invalid for the application's feature manifest. This is especially useful for deeply nested feature configurations. (erichards)
