<br/>
Feature Callouts point to and describe features in content pages or the browser chrome. Multiple messages can be used to create feature tours. The callout element is embedded in the page content and does not block other interactions. Callouts may be configured with a primary action and an optional dismiss button. The arrow can be positioned in the middle of one of the calloutâ€™s sides or either of its top corners. This surface is currently only available for Firefox View and the PDF viewer.
