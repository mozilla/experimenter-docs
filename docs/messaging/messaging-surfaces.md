The following messaging surfaces are currently remotely available in Firefox Desktop, meaning that you create new messages *without* shipping code changes.

## Doorhanger

<br/>
Doorhangers, also known as Contextual Feature Recommendation Panels, are anchored to a UI element such as the application menu, the identity panel, the Firefox View tab, and so on. They can include a configurable icon beside the title. Doorhangers do not reappear once the primary action button is clicked, irrespective of any frequency caps on the message. Clicking the primary button adds the message id to a block list and its messaging system impression are cleared.

## Feature Callouts

<img src="/img/messaging/feature-callout-pdf.png" alt="Example of feature callout in the PDF viewer with upper right arrow" className="img-sm"/>
<br/>
Feature Callouts point to and describe features in content pages or the browser chrome. Multiple messages can be used to create feature tours. The callout element is embedded in the page content and does not block other interactions. Callouts may be configured with a primary action and an optional dismiss button. The arrow can be positioned in the middle of one of the calloutâ€™s sides or either of its top corners. This surface is currently only available for Firefox View and the PDF viewer.

## Infobar

## Moments Pages
This type of message is a URL that the browser will open at the start of the browsing session and will focus on that tab.

## Legacy Spotlight
<img src="/img/messaging/legacy-spotlight.png" alt="Example of legacy spotlight component" className="img-sm" />
<br/>
This is a window level modal, all other interactions are prevented. The user is given a primary and a secondary button to interact with the modal. Legacy Spotlight modals can include a configurable icon above the title. This surface will likely be deprecated in favor of the more flexible Multistage Spotlight modal.

## Multistage Spotlight
<img src="/img/messaging/spotlight-center-simple.png" alt="Example of spotlight component with single centered screen" className="img-sm-left" />
<img src="/img/messaging/spotlight-qr-app-store.png" alt="Example of spotlight component with centered screen, QR code, email link, and app store buttons" className="img-sm" />
<br/>
<img src="/img/messaging/spotlight-center-noodles.png" alt="Example of spotlight component with centered screen, step indicator, and noodles" className="img-sm-left" />
<img src="/img/messaging/spotlight-center-dark-steps.png" alt="Example of spotlight component with centered screen, step indicator, and noodles in dark mode" className="img-sm" />
<br/>
<img src="/img/messaging/spotlight-split.png" alt="Example of spotlight component with split screen" className="img-sm-left" />
<img src="/img/messaging/spotlight-split-dark-checkbox.png" alt="Example of spotlight component with split screen and checkbox in dark mode" className="img-sm" />
<br/>
This surface can be configured as a window or tab level modal, and all other interactions are prevented. The modal's configuration is highly flexible and may include primary and secondary actions, a logo image, background, dismiss button, localized app store icons, QR code with associated link, checkboxes, decorative noodles, and more. A given message may be configured with multiple screens. Progress through these screens may be displayed as a step indicator or a progress bar. Each screen can use a centered, single panel layout or a split screen layout with an image and/or hero text on one side and all other modal content on the other.
