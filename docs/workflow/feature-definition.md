In the experimentation ecosystem, experiment surfaces are described as features. A feature is an area of code instrumented with telemetry and accessible for remote configuration. It can be as small as a single function or as complex as a whole page. Some examples:

    aboutwelcome: The about:welcome page in Desktop
    homescreen: The homescreen page in Fenix
    tabTrayFeature: The tab tray in Firefox iOS


Features are defined in a Feature Manifest file for the application, and the client code uses the Nimbus SDK to access variables associated with those features.

## To define your feature in the feature manifest file
First, look at what is already defined in the manifest file:
* [Desktop](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/nimbus/FeatureManifest.yaml)
* Mobile
    * [Fenix/Android](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/blob/main/nimbus.fml.yaml)
    * [Firefox iOS](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios/blob/main/nimbus.fml.yaml)
    * [Focus iOS](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-ios/blob/main/nimbus.fml.yaml)
