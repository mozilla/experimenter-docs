**Draft content**

In the designing phase of the experimentation workflow it is important to consult with a data scientist in order to:
* do this
* do that
* something something audience
* determine targeting needs (custom or default)

## Types of experiments

| Experiment                                 | A/B - equal sizes. Size fixed at launch - cannot grow.                    | Y                  | One per feature at a time.   Avoids other live experiments on a specific feature.  Keep as small as possible to learn.                        | Fixed timeframe. 7 day typically.  Analysis only AFTER enrollment ends | Automated for default metrics.  Can select outcomes or create new custom                     | Stat sig differences from control + absolute counts.                                                                                               | No - all changes delivered through nimbus reverted.                                                       |

Requires OpMon configured or team using their own custom dashboards.         | Code changing/fixes landing during. Risk mitigation for quick major breaking stability / perf changes.   Looking at adding search metrics as well. | N Same as experiment                                                                                      |
