For an overview of experiment lifecycle, [ See Experiment Workflow Overview ](https://experimenter.info/workflow/overview/#experimentation-workflow)

After you've prepared your experiment brief, entering the info into the [Nimbus/experimenter console](https://experimenter.services.mozilla.com/) should not take a long time. The role of experiment owner is most frequently played by a Product Manager, though others may act in this capacity.  Please follow the [Getting Started: Product Manager guidance](/for-product) before using Nimbus/experimenter for the first time.  If it is your first time - feel free to ask for a "shadow" in #ask-experimenter.  A "shadow" is an experienced experiment buddy to answer questions on zoom while you fill out your first experimenter form.

Experimenter is intended to be flexible and simple to use by allowing users to:

* Save pages, leave the console, and come back to it later without having lost any of their information.
* Go back and forth between all pages through the sidebar, without having to have completed the page completely. 
* Edit or modify all information while your experiment is in Draft state.
* Put your experiment into Preview mode for QA and self-testing

### Risks 

There are questions in the Experimenter form to help you identify possible risks. See the [risk mitigation section](/risk-mitigation) for how to mitigate these risks.

### Notifications

Experimenter automatically sends email notifications to help owners keep track of important dates. See [notifications](/notifications) for more details.
