If your experiment includes ANY message, make sure you had an [in-product message consult](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FIREFOX/pages/208308555/Message+Consult+Creation) and filed an [FXE Jira ticket](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/FXE/boards/543) that was triaged via the Desktop or Mobile messaging leads (Venetia and Courtney).  

This is to ensure we are using a consistent voice with users - and also to make sure we don’t inadvertently send multiple messages that don’t flow together to the user.
