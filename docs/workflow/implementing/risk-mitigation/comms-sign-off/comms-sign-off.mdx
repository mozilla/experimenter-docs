If your experiment includes ANY message, make sure you had an [in-product message consult](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FIREFOX/pages/208308555/Message+Consult+Creation)  and filed an [FXE Jira ticket](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/FXE/boards/543) that was triaged via the Desktop or Mobile messaging leads (Venetia and Courtney).  

This is to ensure we are using a consistent voice with users - and also to make sure we don’t inadvertently send multiple messages that don’t flow together to the user.


Ideally work with your comms or PR contact for your area to let them know the details of the experiment and why a risk has been identified.  If you don’t know where to start for Comms help for your area - #cccc is a channel where you can get help.  That channel also has a runbook document linked that has some more information on ways to engage with the Comms team.

It is very rare for any pro-active comms to come for an experiment - but we have had “reactive comms” ready around several user visible feature changes or messages.  Having reactive comms prepared and flagging the experiment for the support team makes responding to any incident quicker and less likely to escalate badly.
