# Feature team setting up a Foxfood

Create a rollout with the change you want Mozillians to be able to try. 
Set the Audience size to the lowest it will accept - or .0001 with 1 expected client.  We aren't going to actually launch this - but lowest is always safest.
Click "Preview for Testing" - and it's ready!


# Foxfooding with Nimbus Dev Tools

Start by installing Nimbus Dev Tools.  If you aren't a developer, don't let the "Dev Tools" or add-on scare you away. This is easy!

Here is a [65 second video on how to install Nimbus dev tools](https://mozilla.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=b7b2d02b-79ba-43a0-a708-b2a60107f0bf). Watching the video takes half the time to getting Nimbus Dev Tools installed. 
Here is the [link to docs on how to install Nimbus Dev Tools](https://experimenter.info/nimbus-devtools-guide#installation). 
The very first link on that page is to the [Nimbus DevTools GitHub](https://github.com/mozilla-extensions/nimbus-devtools/releases) repository, where you can find the one click XPI file install.
