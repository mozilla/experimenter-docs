# Feature team setting up a Foxfood

Create a rollout with the change you want Mozillians to be able to try. 
Set the Audience size to the lowest it will accept - or .0001 with 1 expected client.  We aren't going to actually launch this - but lowest is always safest.
Click "Preview for Testing" - and it's ready!


# Foxfooding with Nimbus Dev Tools

Start by installing Nimbus Dev Tools.  If you aren't a developer, don't let the "Dev Tools" or add-on scare you away. This is easy!

1. Go directly to the [Nimbus DevTools GitHub](https://github.com/mozilla-extensions/nimbus-devtools/releases) repository, where you can find the one click XPI file install.  Once that installs, you are ready to use Nimbus Dev Tools to Foxfood
2. Open the nimbus dev tools add-on (through puzzle piece or hamburger menu)
3. Go to "experiment browser", then change the top filter for "Status" to "Preview"
4. Find the Foxfooding rollout name you wish to try
5. For that Foxfooding rollout - click "select branch" and select the only option
6. click "actions" and select "force enroll"
- You can verify in about:studies (you may need to refresh page) and you will be enrolled to foxfood.
