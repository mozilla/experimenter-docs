## Find an existing experiment

If the experiment was run with Nimbus, check out the [directory of live and completed experiments](https://experimenter.services.mozilla.com/nimbus/). Normandy experiments can be found [here](https://experimenter.services.mozilla.com/).

If the experiment is not yet live, you will probably be able to find a relevant Jira ticket on this [Data Science Experimentation Collaboration Board](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/DS/boards/258)
