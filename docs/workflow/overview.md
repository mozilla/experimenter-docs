## Find an existing experiment

If the experiment was run with Nimbus, check out the [directory of live and completed experiments](https://experimenter.services.mozilla.com/nimbus/). Normandy experiments can be found [here](https://experimenter.services.mozilla.com/).

## Links to experimentation tools
Here is the [link to Nimbus Console](https://experimenter.services.mozilla.com/nimbus/) - where new experiments are created, reviewed/launched, monitored, and eventually have the results.
Here is the [link to STAGE for Nimbus Console](https://stage.experimenter.nonprod.dataops.mozgcp.net/nimbus/).  This is where you can create experiments and learn how to interact with the tools without impacting production users.

If the experiment is not yet live, you will probably be able to find a relevant Jira ticket on this [Data Science Experimentation Collaboration Board](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/DS/boards/258)
