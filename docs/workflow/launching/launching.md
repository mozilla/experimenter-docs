This guide explains the final steps to launch your experiment after QA testing and risk mitigation are complete.

## Launch Process

After your experiment has passed QA and you've mitigated the risks, you are ready to launch!

Your experiment should be in [Preview mode](https://experimenter.info/previewing-experiments) - from the QA testing and/or your self-test.

At this point you check off the questions accepting responsibility and verifying that you've completed the training, then click "Request Launch".

## Requesting Review

Now you follow the directions in Experimenter: Copy the URL for your experiment. Include the URL and ask for review to launch either from a reviewer on your team or go to #ask-experimenter and ask for someone to help review and approve the launch. If none of the general reviewers approves the launch in a couple of hours - ping again. It is usually quite quick.
