Experiment results are availabe from the Results Link on your experiment page.  Experiments typically take 24 hours after ending to generate the overall results.  

At the top of your results page under "Analysis" is an information box that provides information on your results, if there were issues there will be an error here, if there were custom data modifications it will share what those are, etc.  Please read this and ask questions to your assigned data scientist or in #ask-experimenter if you need help.

By default - results are shown by [Exposure Events](https://experimenter.info/missing-exposure/).  If you don't see results for your experiment - trying going to the Results Config bar on the left of your Results page and click the "enrollments" radial button.  

If you have questions about reading your results please ask the assigned data scientist, attend the mobile or desktop [office hours](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DATA/pages/6849684/Office+Hours), or you can look [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ASlVAds63qOzCDnyLWlbKAcgvTkVfojDeGFqIYty4iI/edit#slide=id.g2c92bc5ab6b_0_0) for the basics on how to interpret.
