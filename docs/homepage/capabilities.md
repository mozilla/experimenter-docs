## Experiment Types

| Experiment               | A/B - equal sizes. Size fixed at launch - cannot grow.                    | Y                  | One per feature at a time.   Avoids other live experiments on a specific feature.  Keep as small as possible to learn. | Fixed timeframe. 7 day typically.  Analysis only AFTER enrollment ends | Automated for default metrics.  Can select outcomes or create new custom | Stat sig differences from control + absolute counts.                                               | No - all changes delivered through nimbus reverted.                                |
