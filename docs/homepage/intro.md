Welcome to the [Experimenter](https://experimenter.services.mozilla.com/nimbus/) documentation hub, your central resource for A/B experiments and feature rollouts in Firefox Mobile and Desktop. You should find these documents helpful if you are:

* A **product manager** and you have a hypothesis you want to test or a feature you'd like to safely release.
* An **engineer** who needs to implement an experiment or feature rollout in your client
* A **data scientist** helping to design and interpret experiment results
* A **Mozilla leader** who would like insight into completed and ongoing experiments and rollouts.


## What is covered here?

These documents are specific to the Mozilla experimentation program known as **Nimbus**.  Nimbus experimentation and support is currently available for our Firefox Desktop and Mobile browser applications.  

Our platform code is all open-source however, we do not offer support or services to 3rd party consumers. Some documentation links may only be available to Mozilla employees and NDA contributors.

## What other tools exist

The following projects have bespoke tools for experimentation.  These are not included as part of this documentation with the exception of a [migration guide from Normandy to Nimbus](desktop-migration-guide) for engineers.

* Firefox Desktop (legacy experimentation): [Normandy](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Normandy/PreferenceRollout)
* Mozilla Websites (a/b experiments): [Bedrock](https://github.com/mozilla/bedrock)
* Firefox Accounts (limited content server): [Fxa docs](https://mozilla.github.io/ecosystem-platform/reference/experiments-ab-testing)
