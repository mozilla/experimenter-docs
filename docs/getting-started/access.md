With Nimbus experiments, instead of a centralized committee responsible for launching and running experiments **we want you, the experiment owner, to drive the process from ideation to completion**.

If you are interested in learning more about your responsibilities, you can find our complete [Access Control Policy here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r8oI_Hxe5JQcOejqZcSziX1Aso20AFGBToTFu3BE5j8/edit).

### Onboarding for New Authors (L2)

In order to use the Nimbus platform to create and launch experiments, you will need to go through our [onboarding process](https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/FJT/Nimbus+Onboarding#NimbusOnboarding-Branches). Please reach out to Ana Medinac on Slack to schedule a session.

### Onboarding for New Reviewers (L3)

Assuming you have been vouched for by a Nimbus admininstrated + a Product Owner (product manager or engineering manager if the team doesnâ€™t have a dedicated PM), you should go through the following steps to get review access on Nimbus:

#### Basic access
* Read through [rules and responsibilities for L3 users](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r8oI_Hxe5JQcOejqZcSziX1Aso20AFGBToTFu3BE5j8/edit#heading=h.6v62tolv8dnv). Please note that you will have access to making changes in production for all experiments, and you should decline if you don't feel sufficiently qualified to review an experiment
* Follow the steps [setup VPN](https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/SD/VPN)
* [File a bug using this template](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Cloud%20Services&component=Server%3A%20Remote%20Settings) to be added to either or both of the following collections: `nimbus-experiments-desktop` and/or `nimbus-experiments-mobile` for your LDAP to be added on staging and production.

#### Testing Review Workflow on Staging
* Connect to the VPN
* Go to [Nimbus Staging](https://stage.experimenter.nonprod.dataops.mozgcp.net/nimbus/) (not Production!). Ask someone to create a dummy experiment and request review.
* Click "Approve" on the dummy experiment, and then "Open Remote Settings":

* **CHECK TO MAKE SURE THE SLUG OF THE DIFF MATCHES THE CHANGE YOU ARE APPROVING** This is important!!
* Press approve if everything looks good. If anything looks wrong, Reject and alert nimbus core team in #ask-experiments
* Congrats, you have tested the workflow. You are now ready to review real experiments on production!

### Reviews

All changes to experiments and rollouts that impact production must be approved by a single L3 Nimbus reviewer, which you can request via the Nimbus console interface. You can find a list of [recommended reviewers here](https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/FJT/Nimbus+Reviewers).
