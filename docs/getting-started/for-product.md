## What is the role of the Experiment Owner in experimentation?

Product Managers often write the initial experiment to capture the logistical information, but it can also be engineers or program managers.  Often engineers fill in the technical change information - so ownership can be a collaboration to get the logistical and technical information for the remote change entered correctly.

Responsibilities include:

- Watching training for new experiment owners [here](https://mozilla.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=f3fbf06a-47ce-4e6d-b949-b0f20134a1c7) - the slide deck in the video is [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ASlVAds63qOzCDnyLWlbKAcgvTkVfojDeGFqIYty4iI/edit#slide=id.p)
- Starting and completing the [experiment brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_bWn_1y5x1zf6zl7Loj4O1qKnVdxzIMXOawIpf32CsM/edit?usp=share_link) - which aligns everyone supporting the experiment to the learning goals.
- Align on the design of the experiment by attending a [data science office hours](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dH-aG8IsYtq6881_Q_cyEtmxli0bK7nuVcUD-5D7q-s/edit%23&sa=D&source=calendar&ust=1646684514330583&usg=AOvVaw0O5Sbz3fHVx2rFDcl3DpNg) on [Wednesday and Thurday](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DATA/pages/6849684/Office+Hours) and filing a [data org Jira ticket](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/DO/boards/269).
- Creating the [Data Org Jira ticket](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/DO/boards/269) (linked in experiment brief)
- Implementing the experiment in [Nimbus console AKA Experimenter](https://experimenter.services.mozilla.com)
- Creating the [QA "Nimbus/Remote delivery" Jira ticket](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=10212&issuetype=11290) (linked in experiment brief)
- Launching the experiment, ending enrollment, ending experiment (the [experimentation workflow](/workflow/overview))
- Working with the experiment team (in slack at #ask-experimenter) to identify a set of reviewers trained and authorized to review experiments in your feature area. The experiment team will train them on how to review.

## Where do I start?

- Watch the 5 minute video on [experiment workflow](https://experimenter.info/workflow/overview) for an overview of the experiment lifecycle to understand the stages / ordering. Use the [Workflow Miro board](https://experimenter.info/workflow/overview) as your source for current links and guidance.

:::tip IMPORTANT
**You must watch the training video before writing your first experiment.** 
- The training for new experiment owners is [here](https://mozilla.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=3bcc9a08-50a4-45bb-88fe-af2001116cb3) 
- The slide deck in the video is [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ASlVAds63qOzCDnyLWlbKAcgvTkVfojDeGFqIYty4iI/edit?usp=share_link).
:::

- **Ask any questions in ask-experimenter** (you will have questions the first few times). Please ask for a shadow in #ask-experimenter your first time(s) through and someone will hop on zoom to write with you. We are happy to help people through the learning curve.
- **Start by opening the Experiment Brief link.** If it is your first [Experiment Brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_bWn_1y5x1zf6zl7Loj4O1qKnVdxzIMXOawIpf32CsM/edit?usp=share_link) - there is an optional 5 minute ["how to video"](https://mozilla.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=178918e0-cc77-4acd-a0a6-ae5c00e3cb68).
- **Fill out your experiment brief.** As the Product Manager you are responsible for clearly articulating the product goals and questions that need to be answered. Capture as much as you can. It will improve and evolve as you have conversations with different subject matter experts. The experiment brief is the authoritative source to capture the shared understanding.
   - **Referencing one source (the experiment brief)** for the verbose experiment background enables the subject matter experts (engineering, QA, experiment tooling, data) to efficiently support the effort and respond to changing requirements. 
   - The experiment owner will **keep editing the experiment brief** throughout the lifecycle of the experiment. Capture the decisions as they are made back in your experiment brief. Decisions left in in slack channels, verbal discussions, various notes, jira tickets, etc - increase the likelihood of errors and wasted effort..
   - There is a **Checklist section** at the end of your Experiment Brief to help you through the steps of your experiment.
- **Link the experiment brief to your experiment** when you create your experiment in the [Nimbus experiment tool](https://experimenter.services.mozilla.com/).

## Key Resources for Experiment Owners

Rather than duplicate links that may later break as the process improves - links to the resources and training videos are in the [Workflow Miro Board](https://experimenter.info/workflow/overview).

- There are several weekly touchpoints [Office Hours](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DATA/pages/6849684/Office+Hours) for in person assistance from subject matter experts in different areas.
- If you are confused on any aspect - that's expected the first few experiments until you've gotten the rhythm. Ask in the #ask-experimenter Slack channel - it is an open community of support from several disciplines.

## Example of how to construct a balanced launch plan

[What Velocity team practices today]

- First, run a small experiment
  - Goal: Reduce business risk and decide whether to ship
  - Example: 5% of users\*; observe DAU impact of 1% to 10%
- Then, if results of small experiment is positive, ship via rollout + holdback
  - Goal: Measure impact at scale
  - Example: 50% of users, 25% get feature and the other 25% doesn’t; observe DAU impact of 3%-5%

\*Note that: 5% can be whatever population you choose to target. Can be en-US, “infrequent users”, “users who haven’t imported bookmarks”, etc.
