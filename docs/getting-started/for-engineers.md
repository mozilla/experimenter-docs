Engineers are typically tasked with implementing an experiment on a new surface with an experiment that has been designed by their product manager in partnership with a data scientist.

## To get started with implementation

* Review the experiment design document.
* Determine if you need to implement any additional telemetry collection
* Check if you need to implement a custom audience
* Confirm the name of the feature and follow the guide to [adding a new feature to the manifest](http://localhost:3000/feature-definition#to-define-your-feature-in-the-feature-manifest-file)
