## How can leadership interact with experiments?
*  [Nimbus Console](https://experimenter.services.mozilla.com/nimbus/) is the best place for exploring what is running, completed, and in draft.  Currently there is basic filtering - which will be expanded this year to enable easier experiment discovery.
*  Each experiment should have an Experiment Brief following this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eFGL9FATIuZudjSItpIT2Ct1C5qb5E3Qk7hJuJQT67s/edit#), as a link from Nimbus Console - which goes into the background, learning goals, and experiment design.
*  After an experiment is completed, there is a Results link in the right hand vertical gray bar.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8192232/171439876-33124105-514b-40ec-8edc-cfa4fd681ffb.png)

*  For completed experiments, there should be information added to Nimbus Console in the "Takeaways" section for a high level tl;dr interpretations and actions taken for each experiment.  If that is blank - ask the Product Manager for the takeaways and learnings and to fill that section. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8192232/171439992-3bb9c53d-0595-40d9-99ee-7b20d5e3f5b7.png)


## Where do I find Experimentation Program metrics?
The [Experiment Tracking spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oEvS0CI52kod7i-prk8rnVPr_6Nk19QSBVHAvxmVRgI/edit?gid=408542968#gid=408542968) is the current source of truth on experimentation program metrics.
*  This is updated monthly before Product Days
*  The summary view has the SPI metrics that are being reported out regularly.
*  Tabs for "by feature" and "by area" information in graph format for experiments based on feature area and area (desktop, mobile, platform).

Until we improve discovery in the Console - the **2022 data** sheet tab is a possible hack to discover experiments. There are comments at the top cell of each column explaining what is being captured.
*  **Please do not edit it**.
*  Example: you can find experiments that had a "CDOU Stat Sig" and "Leading Indicator Stat Sig" change. to easily find experiments that saw a stat sig change.
*  Ask Shell, Jim Thomas, Devyani, or Daniel Berry for help interpreting anything in that spreadsheet.
