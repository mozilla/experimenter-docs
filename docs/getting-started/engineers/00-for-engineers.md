This guide provides resources for engineers implementing experiments, including platform-specific integration guides and implementation steps.

## Overview

Engineers are typically tasked with implementing an experiment on a new surface with an experiment that has been designed by their product manager in partnership with a data scientist.

## Integrating with a New App

* [Getting Started for Nimbus Web Integration](platform-guides/web/integration)
* [Mobile UI needed for Nimbus](/platform-guides/android/mobile-ui)

## Getting Started with Implementation

* Review the experiment design document.
* Determine if you need to implement any additional telemetry collection
* Check if you need to implement a custom audience
* Confirm the name of the feature and follow the guide to [adding a new feature to the manifest](https://experimenter.info/feature-definition#to-define-your-feature-in-the-feature-manifest-file)
