## To get started with implementation

* Review the experiment design document.
* Determine if you need to implement any additional telemetry collection
* Check if you need to implement a custom audience
* Confirm the name of the feature and follow the guide to [adding a new feature to the manifest](https://experimenter.info/feature-definition#to-define-your-feature-in-the-feature-manifest-file)
