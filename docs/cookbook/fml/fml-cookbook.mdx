# Feature Manifest Cookbook

The [Feature Manifest Language](/fml-spec) is a tool and specification designed to help application developers manage tooling to interact with Nimbus. It sits on top of the [Feature Variables API](/mobile-feature-api), and eliminates many of the weaknesses of that API:

 * No magic strings: application code now accesses configuration through generated data classes.
 * Default values are specified away from the code.
 * Channel specific configuration.
 * Decreasing interaction with `experimenter` for application developers. Experimenter picks up changes in the manifest each day.

This is the start of a collection of recipes and patterns that we're discovering.
