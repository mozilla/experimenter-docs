# Feature Manifest Cookbook

The [Feature Manifest Language][/fml-spec] is a tool and specification designed to help application developers manage tooling to interact with Nimbus. It sits on top of the [Feature Variables API][/feature-variables-and-me], and eliminates many of the weaknesses of that API:

 * no magic strings: application code now accesses configuration through generated data classes.
 * default values are specified away from the code.
 * channel specific configuration.
 * Decreasing interaction with `experimenter` for application developers. Experimenter picks up changes in the manifest each day.

This is the start of a collection of recipes and patterns that we're discovering.

1. [Managing collections not known before release](growable-collections)
