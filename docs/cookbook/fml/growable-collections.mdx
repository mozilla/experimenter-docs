## Problem

You want to configure a collection of things of the same type, but the configuration isn't known at build time.

For example,

 * a collection of messages, or
 * a collection of wallpapers.

## Solution

Use a type of `Map<String, T>`.

```yaml
---
channels:
  - debug
  - release
features:
  theming-feature:
    description: Configuration for theming feature.
    variables:
      asset-urls:
        description: A collection of downloadable assets
        type: Map<String, String>
        default: {}
  defaults:
    - channel: debug
      value:
        assets-urls:
          kittens: https://placekitten.com/600/900
          bill-murray: https://www.fillmurray.com/600/900
          flickr: https://loremflickr.com/600/900
    - channel: release
      value:
        assets-urls:
          default-theme: https://www.mozilla.com/assets/wp-default/600/900

```

The collection of URLs is available in code as:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: "Swift", value: "swift" },
    { label: "Kotlin", value: "kotlin" },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="swift">

```swift
let themingConfig = MyNimbus.features.themingFeature.value()
let assetMap: [String: String] = themingConfig.assetUrls

// A list of URLs
let urls = assetMap.values().compactMap { URL(string: $0 )}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
val themingConfig = MyNimbus.features.themingFeature.value()
val assetMap: Map<String, String> = themingConfig.assetUrls

// A list of URLs
val url = assetMap.values().mapNotNull { URL(it) }
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Discussion

The feature manifest defines the shape i.e. the types, of the complete configuration for a feature. It also defines a default configuration which the app uses if there are no experiments running.

```yaml
      asset-urls:
        description: A collection of downloadable assets
        type: Map<String, String>
        default: {}
```

This might be represented as JSON:

```json
{
    "asset-urls": {}
}
```

The default configuration of a feature can be changed by experiments, rollouts and within the manifest itself.

However, these changes are performed by _patching_ the default config, rather than by _replacement_.

The algorithm for patching is given by the [JSON Merge Patch RFC7396][1], which is approximately: JSON objects get merged,
and scalars and lists are replaced, and `null` causes a deletion.

[1]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7396

We'll continue our example to illustrate this in more detail:

In the release population, the default JSON for the the `theming-feature` patched on to the minimal configuration above:

```json
{
    "asset-urls": {
        "default-theme": "https://www.mozilla.com/assets/wp-default/600/900"
    }
}
```

This came from a channel specific default within the manifest itself.

Some of the release population may be under experiment. An experiment branch sets up the feature thus:

```json
{
    "asset-urls": {
        "protocol-theme": "https://www.mozilla.com/assets/wp-protocol/600/900"
    }
}
```

At the same time, another experiment may have just terminated, and a branch declared the winner. The experiment owner has decided to promote this branch to the whole population as a rollout.

```json
{
    "asset-urls": {
        "ufi-theme": "https://www.mozilla.com/assets/wp-ufi/600/900"
    }
}
```

So the final configuration that the app receives for the feature is a merging of all three:

```json
{
    "asset-urls": {
        "default-theme": "https://www.mozilla.com/assets/wp-default/600/900",
        "protocol-theme": "https://www.mozilla.com/assets/wp-protocol/600/900",
        "ufi-theme": "https://www.mozilla.com/assets/wp-ufi/600/900"
    }
}
```

As long as the keys are unique, the collection will grow each time a rollout or experiment affects the feature.

Finally, successful rollouts are likely going to be persisted: now we have learned a particular asset performs well, we should make it part of the next release.

On the next release, rollouts of successful assets would likely be folded back into the manifest itself, and so the manifest becomes the repository of successful assets.

As time goes by, we have a growing collection of asset-urls, without needing to change the code at all.

This is a very powerful pattern which is used in multiple places, so we'll name this pattern "Growable Collections".

### Exposure events

Features with a growable collection of things may need to give some care about exposure events.

Recall: exposure events should be sent when the user is exposed to the treatment.

If we wish to experiment with a particular asset, the application feature should detect which asset being shown, and then only
record an exposure only when that asset is being shown. We can do this by adding an extra variable into the feature.

```yaml
      asset-under-experiment:
        description: The key into the asset urls map of the asset we wish to test.
        type: Option<String>
        default: null
```

This allows us to be specific in the experiment payload that the `protocol-theme` is the asset we wish to experiment with.

```json
{
    "asset-urls": {
        "protocol-theme": "https://www.mozilla.com/assets/wp-protocol/600/900"
    },
    "asset-under-experiment": "protocol-theme"
}
```

In the application code, we check to see if the asset being displayed is the one we're interested in, and only then record an exposure.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="swift"
  values={[
    { label: "Swift", value: "swift" },
    { label: "Kotlin", value: "kotlin" },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="swift">

```swift
let config = MyNimbus.features.themingFeature.value()
let key = selectKey(from: themingFeature.assetMap)

if key == config.assetUnderExperiment {
    MyNimbus.features.themingFeature.recordExposure()
}

displayAsset(url: config.assetMap[key])
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin">

```kotlin
val config = MyNimbus.features.themingFeature.value()
val key = selectKey(from: themingFeature.assetMap)

if (key == config.assetUnderExperiment) {
    MyNimbus.features.themingFeature.recordExposure()
}

displayAsset(config.assetMap[key])
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Local development

Channel specific `defaults` allow us to specify a list of assets prepopulated with placeholders. The defaults for the
`debug` channel for this feature are derived directly from manifest.

```json
{
    "assets-urls": {
        "kittens": "https://placekitten.com/600/900",
        "bill-murray": "https://www.fillmurray.com/600/900",
        "flickr": "https://loremflickr.com/600/900"
    }
}
```

Local development can then proceed with these placeholders, while other channels do not.
