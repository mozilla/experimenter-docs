title: Metrics
---

A *metric* describes an aggregation of user activity,
reflected in product telemetry or another data source,
to a scalar value per user.

For example, "sum of a user's active hours" is a metric.
So is "a user's average page load time."

Metrics are applied over a window of time,
called an analysis window.
The [Jetstream overview](jetstream.md) has more details about analysis windows.

:::note What's in a name?

[Glean](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/index.html)
also has a concept called
[metrics](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/appendix/glossary.html#metric);
ours are different.

Jetstream metrics represent aggregations of the recorded values of Glean metrics.

:::

[Statistics](statistics.md) summarize the distribution of metrics
within and between branches of an experiment.

## How do I add a metric to my experiment?

You can add a metric to your experiment
by having a data scientist write a
[custom configuration](configuration.md)
for your experiment, or by associating
an Outcome with your experiment in the Experiment Console.

[Outcomes](outcomes.md) are collections of metrics
that relate to each other.
Data scientists can extend and define outcomes
in the outcomes path of the
[`jetstream-config`](https://github.com/mozilla/jetstream-config/tree/main/outcomes) repository.

A small set of guardrail metrics
specific to each platform
is run by default for each experiment.
These are defined in the main Jetstream repository
in [jetstream/config/](https://github.com/mozilla/jetstream/tree/main/jetstream/config).
